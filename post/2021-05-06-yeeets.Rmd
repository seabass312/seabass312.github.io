This blog gives an example of coding in python and r and how they can be combined. The last part is useful because it shows that these languages are not fully separate but are interrelated in a way and can be used together.

```{R}


yeet<-c(1,3,2)

yeet




```
```{python}
hw = "hello world"
hw[0:11]
```
```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)

hi<-"Walken here!"
```

```{python}
#Python code chunk
hi="Hey I'm"
print(hi,r.hi) #access R-defined objects with r.
```

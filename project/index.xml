      <description>This project was a very interesting one and as such I thought loud and hard about what data I was going to use for it! I am quite passionate about health and fitness. The variables that I collected using MyFitnessPal are Calories, which is the number that I consumed each day and EnoughFiber which is whether or not I got the recommended amount of fiber for the day. The variables that I got from my workout tracker are MaxHR, which is my maximum heart rate, AvgHR, which is my average heart rate, and WoDuration which is the duration of my workout.</description>
